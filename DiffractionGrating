\section*{Abstract}

The aim of this experiment is to characterize a diffraction grating  by determining the  grating parameter $d$, obtaining $d = (870.489 \pm 0.010) \rm \textcolor{white}{a} nm$ in the experiment, where a standard gas lamp of Cadmium is used. An unknown wavelength $\lambda$ is also measured with the same source by using the parameter $d$, obtaining $\lambda = (501.2 \pm 0.3) \rm \textcolor{white}{a} nm$ for the Cadmium's spectrum green line.

\section{Introduction}
	% \PARstart{}{} creates a tall first letter for this first paragraph
	\PARstart{T}{he} experiment consists of characterizing a diffraction grating which diffracts a known incident wavelength coming from a standard gas lamp of Cadmium by studying the diffraction phenomenon.
    
    When a wave passes through an opaque body or through an aperture of diameter less or equal to its wavelength, the ray suffers a deviation. This phenomenon is called diffraction.$[1]$
    
    In this way, a diffraction grating is an optical component formed by periodic spaced difraction elements, where incident light is splitted and diffracted   into several beams travelling in some particular directions. These directions depend on the wavelenght of the light and  the spacing of the grating.
    
    When light is normally incident on the grating, a maximum $m$ is obtained by an angle $\alpha$, so for a given wavelength $\lambda$:
    
  \begin{equation}
    2d\cdot sin\alpha = m \lambda
   \end{equation}
    
   Where $d$ is the grating parameter, $\alpha$ is the angle formed by the normal to the surface grating and the diffracted direction and $m$  is the diffraction order of maximum, which in this experiment is $m=1$.\\
   
      
   The spectrum is the fingersprint of a certain gas. It is shaped by the atomic transition that occurs when an electron in an atom changes its quantum state to another. So, the electron jumps from one energy level to another, in a very short period of time. Meanwhile, electromagnetic radiation is emitted or absorbed by the electron in a frecuency that is proportional to the energy separation of the states jumped.$[3]$ This energy comes up in the form of photons which causes the emission of light.
   
   



% Main Part
\section{Operating method}
	
    First of all, it is necessary to aligne the experimental set-up.  In order to do this, the spectral lamp and the collimator are aligned, so the lamp illuminates correctly its entrance slit. In this way, the eyepiece of the telescope of the goniometer is focused on the cross and the telescope is focused to infinity. 
    
    With the grating in the holder settled perpendicular to the incident beam, it is now possible to observe the image of the slit. At the moment the position $x_0$ in the angular scale of the goniometer is perfectly centred, its value is written down.
    
    To be sure that the alignment is correctly done,  one line of the spectrum diffracted is found  at both sides of the grating, right and left,  which its wavelength $\lambda$ is known. Then, the position of the telescope is fixed  by using the vertical reference and the positions of the telescope  $x_d$ at the right and $x_i$ at the left are measured.

For a good alignment, the differences $|x_d - x_0|$ and $|x_i - x_0|$  should be equal, but if they differ more than 5' arc, the measurements should be repeated in order to reduce the aforementioned difference. Anyway, if it less than 10' arc, the grating is still considered perpendicular to the incident beam. Thus, in this experiment, the value of the reference of $x_0$, studying the clear blue line which its wavelength is $\lambda=480 \rm \textcolor{white}{a} nm$, is:
$$
x_0 = 285^o 10'
$$
About $x_d$ and $x_i$: 
$$
x_d = 301^o 00'
$$
$$
x_i:= 269^o 03'
$$
Then, the differences:
$$
|x_d - x_0| = 15^o50'
$$
$$
|x_i - x_0| = 16^o 07'
$$

So, the difference between both is $17'$, but as it has been told before, it should be less than $5’$ arc, at least $10'$ arc, but there was no time to repeat it. As it will be seen, this is an important source of error that is going to be commented later on. Anyway, the results obtained in the experiment fit with the not-so-good alignment.

    Once the experimental set-up is "correctly" aligned, the realization of the experiment begins by taking 6 measurements of $x_d$ and $x_i$, for a known wavelength $\lambda$, which give us the angle $\alpha = |x_d - x_i|/ 2$. Likewise, the average $\bar{\alpha}$ and the variance $\sigma_{\alpha}^2$ and the variance $\sigma_{\bar{\alpha}}^2$ are calculated by using the equations represented in the appendix of errors. Then, by using Eq.(1) and the value obtained of $\bar{\alpha}$, the parameter $d$ is determined, where we get $d = (870.489  \pm 0.010) \rm \textcolor{white}{a} nm$. 
    
    The next step is to determine an unknown wavelength $\lambda$. In order to get this value, $x_d$ and $x_i$ are measured again 6 times for another spectrum line, so a new value of $\alpha$ is obtained. Then, by using Eq.(1) and parameter $d$ calculated before, the unknown wavelength $\lambda$ is determined, obtaining $\lambda = (501.2 \pm 0.3) \rm \textcolor{white}{a} nm$.
    






\section{Results and analysis}
	
  First of all, the parameter $d$ is determined. In order to get this value, the clear blue line is following. The values of $x_d$ and $x_i$ are collected:

\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Values of $x_d$ and $x_i$ for the clear blue line of the spectrum. The error of the positions is $\epsilon_{x_d}= \epsilon_{x_i} = 1'$.}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c| c|}
Measurement & $x_d $ &  $x_i$  & $\alpha$ \\\hline 
1 & $301^{o} 00'$ & $269^{o} 00'$ & $16^{o} 00'$\\
2 & $301^{o} 04'$ & $269^{o} 01'$ & $16^{o} 02'$\\
3 & $301^{o} 00'$ & $269^{o} 00'$ & $16^{o} 00'$\\
4 & $301^{o} 01'$ & $269^{o} 01'$ & $16^{o} 00'$\\
5 & $301^{o} 02'$ & $269^{o} 01'$ & $16^{o} 01'$\\
6 & $301^{o} 00'$ & $269^{o} 01'$ & $15^{o} 59'$\\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Hence, $\bar{\alpha} = 16.0030^{o} = 0.27932540 \rm \textcolor{white}{a} rad$, and its variance  $\sigma_{\bar{\alpha}}^2 = 0.00000003 \rm \textcolor{white}{a} rad^{2}$  and the variance  $\sigma_{\alpha} = 0.00000018 \rm \textcolor{white}{a} rad^2$. Then, by using Eq.(1), where $\lambda = 480 \rm \textcolor{white}{a} nm$, the result for parameter $d$ is: 
$$
d = 870.489  \rm \textcolor{white}{a} nm
$$

Where the standard deviation is $\sigma_{\bar{d}}=0.010$. Now, the unknown wavelength is determined, where the green line of the spectrum is studied. The values of $x_d$ and $x_i$ are collected:

\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Values of $x_d$ and $x_i$ for the green line of the spectrum. The error of the positions is $\epsilon_{x_d}= \epsilon_{x_i} = 1'$.}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|}
Measurement & $x_d$ &  $x_i$  & $\alpha / ^{o}$\\\hline 
1 & $302^{o} 02'$ & $268^{o} 33'$ & $16^{o} 44'$ \\
2 & $302^{o} 00'$ & $268^{o} 31'$ & $16^{o} 44'$\\
3 & $302^{o} 02'$ & $268^{o} 31'$ & $16^{o} 45'$\\
4 & $302^{o} 03'$ & $268^{o} 33'$ & $16^{o} 45'$\\
5 & $302^{o} 04'$ & $268^{o} 33'$ & $16^{o} 45'$\\
6 & $302^{o} 01'$ & $268^{o} 33'$ & $16^{o} 44'$\\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

So, by using again $|x_d - x_i|/2$, the value of $\bar{\alpha} = 16.74722222^{o} = 0.29229417 \rm \textcolor{white}{a} rad$, where its variance $\sigma_{\bar{\alpha}}^2 = 0.00000003 \rm \textcolor{white}{a} rad^{2} $. Then, by using Eq.(1), where $d = (870.488 \pm 0.010) \rm \textcolor{white}{a} nm$, the result for $\lambda$ is:
$$
\lambda = (501.2 \pm 0.3) \rm \textcolor{white}{a} nm.
$$

As it is possible to see, the value should be a bit more, in fact, given the Cadmium spectrum, for green line $\lambda= 508.6\rm \textcolor{white}{a} nm$ $[2]$, which means a discrepancy of $2\%$, but as it is said before, the alignment is not good, so the results just correspond to said alignment. 



\section{Discussion}

The experimental results were obtained as expected within the incorrect alignment, which means that the experimental design is properly working and the alignment is an important source of error. In order to show this last fact, the alignment is repeated, so this time the difference between  $|x_d - x_0|$ and $|x_i - x_0|$ is 9' arc instead of 17' arc, which is almost the half. Thus, checking for both lines:\\

For clear blue line, $x_d$ and $x_i$: 
$$
x_d = 301^o  01'
$$
$$
x_i:= 269^o 20'
$$

For green line, $x_d$ and $x_i$:
$$
x_d = 302^o  00'
$$
$$
x_i= 268^o 30'
$$

In this way, recalculating parameter $d$, by Eq.(1), the value of $d$ is:
$$
d = 879 \rm \textcolor{white}{a} nm
$$
Then, for the green line, $\lambda$:
$$
\lambda = 506 \rm \textcolor{white}{a} nm
$$

As we can see, the discrepancy has been reduced to  $0.5\%$, so we can conclude that the alignment is the principal source of error. 

\subsection{Proposed questions}

In addition, parameter $d$ shouldn't depend on the wavelength $\lambda$, because $d$ is a physical parameter that is characteristic of the diffraction grating.

In this experiment, a prism can  be used as a diffractor instead of the diffraction grating, but there are differences between both. Images formed by a prism are more brilliant, which means less resolution, because a prism only reflects light in one spectrum. Also, in a prism, the diffraction angle is not directly proportional to the wavelength, so to measure $\lambda$ is necessary to graph $\lambda$ vs $\alpha$ using a source of light that has a known spectrum. Moreover, the calibration of the diffraction grating is less complicated.

Now the diffraction grating studied is characterized, it is possible to identify an unknown emitting gas with this instrument and this grating by measuring the wavelength of its spectral's lines, so other unknown spectrum could be studied.

Concluding, in addition to the transmission diffraction pattern,  a reflection diffraction pattern produced by this grating is observed in the central beam, which corresponds to $m=0$. Hence, using Eq.(1) with $m=0$, it give us a value of 0, which means that  there is not diffraction.

    
\section{In conclusion}
	Both the experimental device of Figure 1 and the approach to the same procedure, represent a good approximation to the theoretical model within the experimental uncertainty. 
    
    Likewise, the experiment has an extraordinary precision when obtaining the results of parameter $d$ and the unknown wavelength $\lambda$.

\section{Appendix of errors}
The variance $\sigma^2$ is the mean of the differences with the mean squared. So the variance of angle $\alpha$ is:
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\alpha}^2 = \frac{1}{(N-1)}\sum_{i=1}^N (\alpha_i - \bar{\alpha})^2
\end{equation}
For $\bar{\alpha}$:

\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\bar{\alpha}}^2  = \frac{\sigma_{\alpha}^2 }{N}
\end{equation}

The standard deviation $\sigma$ tells us how much the values of the average tend to separate from a data distribution. So, the standard deviation for $\bar{d}$ from $\alpha$:
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\bar{d}}  = \sqrt{\left[\frac{\lambda cos\bar{\alpha}}{2sin^2\bar{\alpha}}\right]^2\cdot \sigma_{\bar{\alpha}}^2 }
\end{equation}

And for $\bar{\lambda}$, the standard deviation:

\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\bar{\lambda}}  = \sqrt{(2sin\bar{\alpha})^2\cdot\sigma_{\bar{d}}^2+(2\bar{d}cos\bar{\alpha})^2\cdot\sigma_{\bar{\alpha}}^2 }
\end{equation}

Where $\sigma_{\bar{\alpha}}^2 $ must be in radians.
